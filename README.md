This project began as a small R script that was supposed to help me figure out different salaries and expenses across several countries and industries.
It soon started to grow, invlving online questionaires and polls and data science. I then wrote a series of articles on Medium:

The next logical step was to make this porject public and help others quantify their job seeking experience. 

My goal is to collect data on as many countries as possible, possible write a long paper and maybe a Shinny app sometime in the future.
